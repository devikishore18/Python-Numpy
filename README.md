# ðŸ“¦ NumPy Fundamentals & Hands-On Guide
Welcome to my comprehensive **Numpy repository**!
Complete repository to learn and master **NumPy** â€” from theoretical foundations to hands-on exercises, data manipulation, and visual practice.

---

## Overview
NumPy is the **foundational package for scientific computing in Python**, providing efficient in-memory N-dimensional arrays (`ndarray`), fast operations, broadcasting, linear algebra tools, random number capabilities, and more
---

## Core Concepts
- **ndarray**: fixed-size, homogeneous data containers optimized for performance 
- **Vectorized operations & broadcasting**: apply operations across arrays without Python loops  
- **Array creation & inspection**: `zeros()`, `ones()`, `arange()`, `linspace()`, `shape`, `dtype`  
- **Indexing & slicing**: basic, multi-dimensional, and fancy indexing 
- **Arithmetic & aggregation**: `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, universal functions (`ufuncs`)  
- **Linear algebra & FFT**: dot product, matrix operations, inv, FFT 
---

## Hands-On Examples
Explore the `examples/` folder for scripts and notebooks using real code snippets:
- Creating arrays with `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.linspace`  
- Array operations and broadcasting  
- Reshaping (`reshape`, `ravel`), stacking (`stack`, `vstack`), splitting arrays  
- Combining and iterating operations efficiently 

---

## Visualization & Analysis
Integrate NumPy with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for quick analytics:
- Plot `sin()` and `cos()` on arrays  
- Visualize distributions using histograms  
- Heatmaps for matrix data  
- Linear algebra visual checks (e.g. eigenvalue plots)  
- Use NumPy as data generator for more complex analyses
